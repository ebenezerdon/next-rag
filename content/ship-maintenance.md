# Ship Maintenance 101

## Engine Maintenance
The warp core is the heart of your ship. Treat it well.
- **Cleaning**: Use a microfiber cloth for the exterior. Use a plasma torch for the interior (carefully).
- **Calibration**: Re-calibrate the dilithium matrix every 5,000 light-years.

## Hull Integrity
- Inspect for micro-meteoroid impacts daily.
- Patch small holes with hull sealant.
- For large holes, call a tow truck.

## Artificial Gravity
- If gravity fails, remember: down is relative.
- Magnetic boots are mandatory in zero-G zones.
- Secure all loose objects, especially the cat.
