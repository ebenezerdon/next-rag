# Space Travel Guidelines

## 1. Pre-Flight Checks
Before initiating any warp jump, ensure the following:
- **Quantum Stabilizers**: Must be at 98% efficiency or higher.
- **Life Support**: Check oxygen recycling systems.
- **Snacks**: Ensure adequate supply of freeze-dried ice cream.

## 2. Warp Jump Protocol
1. Engage the inertial dampeners.
2. Verify coordinates with the Galactic Federation Database.
3. Count down from 10 (silently, to not annoy the pilot).
4. Push the big red button.

## 3. Emergency Procedures
In case of a hull breach:
- Don your pressure suit immediately.
- Seal the affected bulkhead.
- Do not panic. Panicking uses up oxygen faster.
